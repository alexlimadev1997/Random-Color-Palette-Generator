# Random-Color-Palette-Generator

## Project motivation
This project aims to create a random hexadecimal color palette.

## Project use

When clicking on the refresh palette button, the "li" in the file will randomly reset your style and generate a new palette


## Challenges

I was able to learn more about how to generate hexadecimal colors, and use padStart() to fill the strings with the number of places needed
